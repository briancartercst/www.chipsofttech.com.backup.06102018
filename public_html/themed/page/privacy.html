                Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                At Chippewa Software Technology, LLC ("ChipSoftTech", "CST", "we", or "us"), we
                are committed to ensuring the privacy of our customers. This Privacy Policy (this
                "Policy") describes how personal information is collected from users of ChipSoftTech's
                website at <a href="../index.html">www.ChipSoftTech.com</a> (the "Site"), and how
                that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms
                of this Policy.</p>
            <strong>Use of Our Site by Children</strong>
            <p>
                We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet.
                This Site is not designed or intended to collect and retain personal information
                from children who are under 18 years of age, and you must be 18 years of age or
                older to purchase products or use the services provided on this Site.</p>
            <strong>What is Personal Information?</strong>
            <p>
                Personal information specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's
                name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number&mdash;and
                information about that individual's activities when directly linked to him or her,
                such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes
                demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences
                when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies an
                individual.</p>
            <p>
                Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information
                is data collected about a group or category of products, services or customers from
                which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information
                about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about
                how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in
                the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be
                collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others.
                Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better
                design new products and services, and refine existing products and services to serve
                our customers better.</p>
            <strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong>
            <p>
                You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit the Site.
                For example, you provide us with personal information when you:</p>
            <p>
                purchase and complete our PondWater Development Strategy or other products;<br />
                purchase additional modules or other report formats;<br />
                purchase access to our online instructional video modules; and/or<br />
                contact us by email for any reason, such as to request help with the Services, or
                to provide us with your comments/feedback.<br />
                We collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, email address, phone number,
                credit card number and expiration date in this manner.</p>
            <strong>How We Use Personal Information</strong>
            <p>
                In general, we use personal information collected on the Site to provide the Services
                and otherwise process transactions on the Site, to provide support for the Services,
                to respond to user requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of our dealings
                with Site users, to develop new products and services and to inform users about
                products or services we think will be of interest.</p>
            <p>
                For example, we use your information to process orders of purchases of products,
                to communicate with you about your product purchases, and/or use of the Services
                or the Site, to provide support in response to your inquiries, to send you promotional
                materials via email and postal mail, to improve our products and services and to
                develop new products and services. When we use your personal information in our
                internal marketing efforts, we provide you with choices (see "Choice," below). We
                may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships,
                and may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain
                about you (for example, we may receive updated information about you, such as an
                updated billing address, from the financial institution issuing your credit card
                in connection with billing for Services). If we do so, this Policy governs such
                information.</p>
            <strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong>
            <p>
                We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your
                prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. We may
                share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing
                internal functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include,
                for example, analyzing traffic information or other data, providing marketing assistance,
                mailing items, processing credit card transactions, and fulfilling or delivering
                orders. In all cases we limit the information shared with our third-party vendors
                to that which is necessary to carry out those functions. We are not responsible
                for any additional information you provide to these parties, and we encourage you
                to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to
                them.</p>
            <p>
                We also disclose personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply
                with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order) or with requests
                of law enforcement authorities; to enforce or apply this Policy or our other policies
                or agreements; to initiate, render, bill and collect for amounts owed to us; to
                protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers
                from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we reasonably believe
                that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury
                to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records
                without delay. In addition, information about our customers, including personally
                identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt
                financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy
                or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred
                to third parties as one of our business assets.</p>
            <strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong>
            <p>
                The Site may contain links to other Web sites. Links from our Site to other sites
                or content are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over
                the content or privacy and security practices and policies of such third parties
                or other sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided
                directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy.
                We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies
                before providing them with personal information.</p>
            <strong>Security</strong>
            <p>
                We have put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss,
                misuse and alteration of information while it is under our control. We cannot, however,
                guarantee the protection of information against interception, misappropriation,
                misuse or alteration, nor can we promise that your information may be not be disclosed
                or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Furthermore,
                we have no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with
                or do business with.
            </p>

            <p>
            Orders placed on our Site are protected by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol
            to ensure privacy and security of your ordering and payment information. We also
            use encryption technologies to protect billing information that we retain. </p>

            <p>
            When you register for a transaction on the Site, we ask you to create a password.
            To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your
            password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible
            for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately
            if you believe your password has been misused or otherwise misappropriated.</p>

            <strong>Choice</strong>
            <p>
                To opt-out of receiving marketing or other promotional communications from us, email

            <strong>Changes to this Policy</strong>
            <p>
                We will modify this Policy if our privacy practices materially change in the future
                and we will notify you of such changes only by posting the modified Policy on our
                Site and indicating at the top of the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage
                you to review this Policy each time you visit our Site to see if it has been updated
                since your last visit and to make sure you understand how information you provide
                will be used.</p>
            <strong>Your Comments or Concerns</strong>
            <p>
                We welcome your feedback. If you have any comments or concerns about this site,
