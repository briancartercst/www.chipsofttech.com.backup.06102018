Thanks for clicking on the guide.
This guide is written for Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, which released
on 4/26/2007 (Japan), 11/20/2007 (US) for Nintendo DS, and the guide is
based on the US version, may contain some differences with the Japan version.

English isn't my first language and my writing skill is not good at all,
so I write this guide in a simple style as easier people can understand.
Not much explainations in the walkthrough, but might still contain a little
spoiler of the game.

Currently this guide only contains some basic and full Walkthrough of the game.
This will not be updating until I finished a major part of it. Or you can visit
my blog (URL below) to check out the rough updates.
