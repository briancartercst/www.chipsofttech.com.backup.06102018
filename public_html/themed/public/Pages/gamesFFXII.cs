 1. INTRODUCTION                              Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

Thanks for clicking on the guide.
This guide is written for Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, which released
on 4/26/2007 (Japan), 11/20/2007 (US) for Nintendo DS, and the guide is
based on the US version, may contain some differences with the Japan version.

English isn't my first language and my writing skill is not good at all,
so I write this guide in a simple style as easier people can understand.
Not much explainations in the walkthrough, but might still contain a little
spoiler of the game.

Currently this guide only contains some basic and full Walkthrough of the game.
This will not be updating until I finished a major part of it. Or you can visit
my blog (URL below) to check out the rough updates.

 2. GAME BASIC                                Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================

 -------------
 << Control >>
 -------------

 D-pad = Move camera (in battlefleid);
         Move character (in World Map)

     A = Jump to friendly summoning gate; Confirm, Select...
     B = Clear all selections; Cancel...
     X = Select all allied units.
     Y = Cycle through groups.

     L = Switch the top and bottom screens, this allows players directly
         move the camera view to the selected area.
     R = Same as L button.

 Start = Open Menu


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ------------------
 << Attack Types >>
 ------------------

There are three types of attack, which act in rock-paper-scissors relationship.

 ~Melee Units
  Melee units attack at close range.
  While effective against ranged unit, their attacks have difficult
  reaching flying units.

 ~Ranged Units
  Ranged units attack from a distance.
  Though very effective against flying units, ranged units are little
  use against foes in melee range.

 ~Flying Units
  Flying units attack from the air.
  Although they can pick off melee units with ease, they're extremely
  vulnerable to ranged units.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ------------------
 << Using Espers >>
 ------------------

 ~Summoning Gate:
  A gate allows you to call out an Esper. You must control a
  summoning gate in order to use it.

    ~Blue Summoning Gates: Gates you control.
    ~Red Summoning Gates: Gates controlled by your enemies.
    ~Colorless Gates: Neutral gates that have not been captured.


 ~Capturing Summoning Gates:
  Move a group leader to summoning gate (Red or Colorless) to capture it
  from your enemy. Once captured, the gate will turn Blue. Be ware that
  enemies will try to capture gates as well. You can capture a gate more
  quickly by sending more units to capture it.


 ~Summoning Espers:
  To summon an Esper, touch a blue summoning gate to bring up the Summon
  command. When summoning an Esper, you must assign it to one of the groups
  led by your main character. There's no need for the character to be near
  the gate.


 ~The Ring of Pacts:
  Selectable Espers are depending on your Ring of Pacts stats.
  Needless to say, only enlisted Espers are available.

    ~Esper with which pacts can be formed glow yellow on the Ring of Pacts.
    ~You can form a pact with an Esper once the Esper adjacent to it is
     enlisted, moving from the inside of the ring outward.
    ~Some Espers only become available once certain conditions are met.


*There are lot more basic information will be explained during the game.

Get close to the wounded man.


Objective:
 - Esort the wounded man to safety!
 - The man and at least one ally must survive.

As Penelo pointed, protect the wounded man to the West end, however, the
monsters are not letting you do this easily. Make sure Llyud is alive just
in case your ally KO'd. And the monsters are unlimited spawning from the
beginning area, so move as fast as possible while trying to break all the
monsters who are blocking your way. Don't forget Vaan has learned Quickening,
you can perform this when the Mist Charge is full, and make sure you use it
into a group since it targets an area.

#= OBJECT OF DESIRE - Tomaj's Camp (+1%)

Objective:
 - Protect Velis!
 - Velis and at least one ally must survive.

I strongly recommend use Lamia for this stage. As we knew Malboro can send
many bad statuses, so it's better let Lamia confuse it before it does. Hold
on until the Great Malboro appears, defeat it to end this. You can perform
Entice from Lamia to confuse the Great Malboro as well.

#= THE DANCE - Tomaj's Camp (+1%)

Objective:
 - Stop Velis!
 - Penelo must survive.

Initially send out a small amount of your Espers to lure any one of the enemy
groups and defeat them before all other groups come together. The important
point is to protect Penelo, so keep your strongest character in the middle,
keep summoning the Esper according to your opponent's weakness. Since Velis
(Odin) won't move until you disturb him, you can first gather a group of
Wyvern and then send all together to fight Velis, it would be easy.

started, breakthrough the group around the first summoning gate as fast as
you can. Afterwards, set your healing units target on Fran to keep her alive
before while facing the enemies from top.

#= AUDIENCE AT THE AURALITH - Auralith's Cradle (+1%)

Objective
 - Defeat the Judge of Wings!
 - At least one ally must survive.
 - Balthier must survive.

Initially capture the summoning gate on the right. With Kytes' magic, this is
quick easy. For the boss, send a rank III Esper to lure her (I'm using Ifrit)
with the support of your healing unit, re-summon your rank III Esper again
when it dies. If Balthier is targetted, you should move your healing units
to save him. Meanwhile, capture the summoning gate behind the boss. Once
you did it, the rest of the battle will become easy.

o---------------o

#= BALTHIER'S BETRAYAL - Auralith's Cradle (+1%)

Objective:
 - Stop Balthier!
 - At least one ally must survive.

There's a little trick you must do at the beginning. First cast Llyud's
Vanishga on an Esper, then send this Esper to left, pass Ba'Gamnan's team,
means this Esper should staying between Balthier and Ba'Gamnan. When the
Vanish status gone, Ba'Gamnan will chase and attack your Esper, now lure
them to Balthier's team and eventually they will fight with each other.

Capture the summoning gate on the left after Ba'Gamnan left, and prepare
your team while waiting Balthier to beat Ba'Gamnan. Fran will probably
get KO'd during this fight. After all, Balthier will come to fight Vaan.
Send a rank III Esper (I use Ifrit since most enemies weak against Fire)
to face your enemies and keep 2 or 3 healing units to support it, hopefully
you had Carbuncle for this. Needless to say, your other combat unit should
fight Balthier together while the rank III Esper is taking damage.

o---------------o
|  MISSION 7-4  |
o---------------o

#= AEGYL UPRISING - The Skies of Lemures (+1%)

Objective:
 - Defeat all enemies!
 - Your soul crystal must survive.

Since all enemies are Flying type, so there's no point to use any
Melee units for this fight. Shiva and Lamia could be useful, if you have
Carbuncle together would be perfect. Remember you must protect your soul
crystal, adn some random enemies which are not leading by and leader will
come directly to your soul crystal, be sure you block and defeat them.

o---------------o
|  MISSION 8-1  |
o---------------o

#= AN IRRESISTIBLE OPPORTUNITY - The Dalmasca Estersand (+1%)

Objective:
 - Destroy the enemy soul crystal.
 - Your soul crystal must survive.

Start by defeating the nearest enemies and capture the summoning gate. Always
pay attention to the moving enemies because they might come straight to destroy
your soul crystal, make sure you guard it well. I suggest take the upper path
to the enemy soul crystal, leave the bottom path with some Ranged and Flying
Espers to defense. Rush to the further summoning gate when the path is clear.
Have a Melee leader and a rank III Esper with the support of Carbuncle or
Penelo would be easy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#= TAKING COUNSEL - Airship-Bridge

Talk to Larsa, Basch and Balthier to unlock some locations which are
Paramina Rift, Giza Plains, and Glabados Ruins. You must visit all three
locations, and it doesn't matter which you choose first. In my game, I've
choosen Giza Plains -> Glabados Ruins -> Paramina Rift.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o---------------o
|  MISSION 8-2  |
o---------------o

#= THE SECLUDED - Giza Plains (+2%)

Objective:
 - Seek out the informant.
 - At least one ally must survive.
 - The informant must survive.

The soldier you need to find is located around the top right part of the map.
Use Vaan for this, cast Sprint and run to right, then to top and speak to the
soldier to end this. Needless the say, ignore all monsters, try run pass them
without using any attack (off your Gambit). You may also try Vanishga from
Llyud as well, without performing any actions, the Vanished character won't
be spotted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#= LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT - The Glabados Ruins (+1%)

Objective:
 - Find the hidden chamber!
 - At least one ally must survive.

You must use Penelo because this map doesn't allow you to summon any Espers,
Kytes is another good choise since his spells are very useful against the
enemies. Touch the Ancient Device at the side to unlock the following gate,
and each time you unlock the gate, some enemies will spawn in the front.
Simply take down the enemies with Kytes' magic. Heal all your character
before you open the next gate.


Objective:
 - Defeat the Elder Wyrm!
 - At least one ally must survive.

After the final gate, Elder Wyrm appears as boss. Not a hard battle, have a
Melee character (Vaan or Basch) to close combat with it, and set Penelo target
to this character.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#= YE WHO REST - The Paramina Rift (+1%)

Objective:
 - Defeat all enemies!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Recommend Bomb and Lamia. Send a Bomb to the massive group of Zombie and
perform its Self-Destruct, this can probably kill all of them in once.
Continue summoning Bombs and do the same thing while going to capture the
summoning gate. Use Lamia's ability to Confuse other enemies when your
Bombs are not summoned yet. When you have breakthrough the first junction
and captured the summoning gate, the rest could be easy.

Use Shivar, Carbuncle, and Mateus (if you've enlisted). Simply clear the
path with Kytes' Blizzaga spell until you reach the goal point.

===============================================================================

o---------------o
|  MISSION 8-4  |
o---------------o

#= WAYWARD SOUL - The Feol Warren (+2%)

Objective:
 - Defeat Chaos!
 - At least one ally must survive.

This is hard! Do except you will face another boss after Chaos, so don't
suicide on defeating Chaos. Try not spending too much time to capture all
summoning gate because Chaos will find you after a moment, and you should
be prepared before that. What I did is send all my allies to capture the
summoning gate on the top, then slowly break down the Chaos' group. Use
Lamia to confuse opponent's Lamia before your allies be confused. Once
you've cleared the enemies around Chaos, send a high HP character to face
him (I use Ashe) with some Carbuncles support. And you should have Kytes
around to guard your team since he can use Blizzaga to finish most enemies
easier. If you think you can control your party very well, delay Chaos action
by luring him to other area with different party while you're capturing more
sommoning gates. Kytes learns Nature's Wrath when Chaos is defeated.


Objective:
 - Defeat Mydia!
 - At least one ally must survive.

For this fight, you can capture the all the summoning gate first. Send your
rank III Esper to the beginning area to handle those unlimited Lamia, with
a Carbuncle support is easy. Likewise, use Kytes to take down those unlimited
enemies with Blizzaga. Don't trigger Mydia's attention before you kill off
the enemies around. Send some Flying type Esper from opposite side to reduce
her HP (Bomb's Self Destruct). When Mydia left about 30% HP, use a Quickening
to finish her off. Again, you must have Carbuncle support because Mydia can
easily kill anyone.

o---------------o

#= WINGED WARRIORS - Gates of Shattered Time (+1%)

Objective:
 - Destroy all enemy leaders!
 - At least one ally must survive.

You have to beat these enemies repeatedly (x4), not hard but takes time.
Each time you start the next round, make sure to heal all allies who're not
at full HP. 

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|  Reward: Dragon Bracers, Auracite x3                                       |
o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o


===============================================================================

o---------------o
|  MISSION 9-2  |
o---------------o

#= CREATOR OF DARKNESS - Throne of Feolthanos (+1%)

Objective:
 - Defeat Feolthanos!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Capture both summoning gates near your starting point. While going to the
middle, prepare for fight three rank III Espers in a row which are Belias,
Mateus and Chaos. If possible, lure Belias away and capture the summoning
gate before beaten Belias. after this, capture the remaining summoning gates.
Use Ranged unit to lure and defeat the foes around Feolthanos, so Feolthanos
would be easier.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|  Reward: Carabineer Mail, Auracite x1                                      |

o---------------o
|  MISSION 9-3  |
o---------------o

#= FALLACY - Throne of Feolthanos (+1%)

Objective:
 - Defeat all enemies!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Another annoying stage, lot of enemies to fight and the area is small.
Try to capture a sommoning gates as soon as possible. Afterwards, capture
to opposite summoning gate without waiting. While doing so, summoning as
many Esper as you can to protect the middle, don't forget your rank III
Esper is most important. Spend Quickening on opponent's Carbunble in a
group is useful. Lamia once again is a good choice for this stage.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|  Reward: -                                                                 |

|  MISSION 9-4  |
o---------------o

#= THE UNCONCSIONABLE - Feolthanos, the Last Auralith (+2%)

Objective:
 - Defeat Mydia!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Clear the middle area can capture the summoning gate if you can, because if
you choose to the corner summoning gate, you might be surrounding unless you
are really fast enough to recover your party before the next group enemies
come. When your status is stable, attack and capture both summoning gates at
the top corner to decrease foes spawning, otherwise it would be very hard to
defeat Mydia when any of the summoning gates still under enemy control. Before
you successfully capture al summoning gates, do not close to Mydia.

o----------------------------------------------------------------------------o
|  Reward: Minerva Bustier, Grand Helm, Auracite x2                          |

 CHAPTER 10 - WINGS ETERNAL
            - Keep of Forgotten Time
===============================================================================

o----------------o
|  MISSION 10-1  |
o----------------o

#= WAITING IN THE WINGS - Womb of Feolthanos (+1%)

Objective:
 - Capture the summoning gates!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Capture the summoning gates one by one, nothing is hard here. By the way,
Shivar is quite good to support other allies.


===============================================================================

o----------------o
|  MISSION 10-2  |
o----------------o

#= THE ABYSS - Womb of Feolthanos

Objective:
 - Destroy the enemy soul crystal.
 - At least one ally must survive.

Gather all units to focus on target enemy group, start by hitting the right
area, then clear the rest in the middle. The last group before the soul crystal
may take some time since the all foes are guarding there. You can lure out some
of them first and then through the other path to reach their soul crystal.


===============================================================================

o--------------------o
|  THE FINAL BATTLE  |
o--------------------o

#= REVENANT WINGS - Feolthanos Exultant

Objective:
 - Defeat Feolthanos!
 - At least one ally must survive.

Set more Ranged and less Melee units. Enemies are only Melee unit, damage not
very strong, but the massive quantity is quite annoy, use Bomb continuously
to get rid if it (Self-Destruct).

Note: enemy's level is depend on your total story completition. 

Once you clear the area, focus on the boss' right hand (top), always take at
least 3 healing units along with your party. Take down the other hand after
this. Do remember keep on summoning when your Esper is down, because it's
hard to recover in this battle once your team allies getting lesser, so be
sure you always have enough unit to push off the unlimited opponents.

Finally, you target is the core, beware the core will attack all everyone in
front of him with his ray, needless to say, this is a powerful attack. To avoid
getting worthless damage, you can attack the core by casting magic beside the
stairs, however you can still sending your Esper up the stairs to attack. But
the main problem is Bahamut, which would appear before you can defeat the boss,
and you should focus on Bahamut when this happens (this is tough!!). Keep your
leader further from Bahamut's spotting target, bring him to the summoning gate
if possible, so you can blast him with lot of Espers on the summoning gate.
After defeating Bahamut, continue damage the core.


Objective:
 - Defeat Feolthanos!
 - Vaan must survive.

In the end, Vaan appears in the throne. Fight with the boss and your allies
will eventually appear to help. Now move Vaan away from the boss, just let
your allies to hit the boss till he's down.


Congratulation! Now you've beaten the game, enjoy the ENDING~!
