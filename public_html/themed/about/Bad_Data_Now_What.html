                        <h1>
                            Weeding Out Bad Data in a Business Process</h1>
                        <p>
                            There are really two types of business users. There are the people who get a report
                            and just implicitly believe everything the report says because it came from a computer.
                            Then there are the people who don’t trust any of the data because they know how
                            much of an issue data quality can be inside any business process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Both approaches represent a black eye for IT. The first scenario is more troubling
                            because it shows there are a lot of people making critical business decisions based
                            on bad data. The latter scenario, meanwhile, raises crucial questions about the
                            value of IT if too many people feel the need to check the data by hand using spreadsheets
                            and paper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Few people want to talk about this because nobody really has had a fix for the problem.
                            Sure, we can invest in data quality and master data management tools to clean up
                            the data. But once bad data is inserted into a business process, it tend to corrupt
                            everything in that process as it continues to be replicated through sometimes hundreds
                            of applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of those issues that is always a source of frustration in the enterprise is
                            the quality of the data we spend so much time and money processing. The quest to
                            make sure we have high quality data is nothing short of a never-ending battle between
                            the forces of order and the chaos that envelopes every attempt to organize anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the last couple of years, however, fighting the good fight over data quality
                            has been getting more attention for a few reasons. The first is simply the amount
                            of time IT organizations have to throw at the problem. With fewer major IT projects
                            being launched in a down economy, spending more time on existing application maintenance
                            and renewal is only a logical consequence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the other major factor at work here is that business wants to share that information
                            much more aggressively than they ever have before. And not only do they want to
                            do that internally, they also want to share that information with customers and
                            suppliers as they move to integrate various business processes involving multiple
                            applications. This can come as a shock to the internal IT department because it
                            forces it to come clean about just how disorganized, and frequently wrong, the data
                            actually is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This issue is what makes a new PondWater Development Strategy&trade; project intriguing.
                            The basic idea is to monitor specific business processes in real time and flag all
                            suspect data. That data can then be investigated and any process or application
                            that relies on that data can be alerted about the potential quality of that information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alas, the war over data quality can never really be won. What can be done is that
                            the number of instances where we have conflicting data and outright errors can be
                            sharply reduced. There’s no shame in having bad data; everybody does. The only real
                            sin is not trying to do anything about it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Brian Carter, ChipSoftTech and iAppFusions Chief Development Officer, says ChipSoftTech
                            is releasing the PondWater Technology as a "pilot" to select partners. It’s clear
                            that with introduction of mobility and sensors, we’re going to see a lot more sophisticated
                            approaches to data governance that could alarm more people on one hand by shaking
                            their confidence in the data, while at the same time pacifying others who already
                            know how bad the problem really is.
